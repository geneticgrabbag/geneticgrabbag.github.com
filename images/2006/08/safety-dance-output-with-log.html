We can dance if we want to
&gt;&gt; Evan can now dance.
&gt;&gt; J.B. can now dance.
&gt;&gt; JoeDoc can now dance.
&gt;&gt; Clio can now dance.
&gt;&gt; We and they have a separation of -10 spots (FarBehind).
&gt;&gt; Can we leave them far behind: True
We can leave your friends behind
'Cause your friends don't dance...
&gt;&gt; Shrub can no longer dance.
&gt;&gt; Rummy can no longer dance.
&gt;&gt; Cheney can no longer dance.
...and if they don't dance
Well they're no friends of mine
&gt;&gt; Removing those friends of Evan who cannot dance
&gt;&gt; Shrub is not a friend of Evan; no need to remove.
&gt;&gt; Rummy is not a friend of Evan; no need to remove.
&gt;&gt; Cheney is not a friend of Evan; no need to remove.
I say, we can go where we want to
&gt;&gt; Evan can now go to WhereWeWantTo.
&gt;&gt; J.B. can now go to WhereWeWantTo.
&gt;&gt; JoeDoc can now go to WhereWeWantTo.
&gt;&gt; Clio can now go to WhereWeWantTo.
A place where they will never find
&gt;&gt; They cannot find us.
And we can act like we come from out of this world
&gt;&gt; Evan is acting like earth is not his/her place of origin.
&gt;&gt; J.B. is acting like earth is not his/her place of origin.
&gt;&gt; JoeDoc is acting like earth is not his/her place of origin.
&gt;&gt; Clio is acting like earth is not his/her place of origin.
Leave the real one far behind.
&gt;&gt; Evan is leaving the real world far behind.
&gt;&gt; J.B. is leaving the real world far behind.
&gt;&gt; JoeDoc is leaving the real world far behind.
&gt;&gt; Clio is leaving the real world far behind.
And we can dance.
&gt;&gt; Evan can now dance.
&gt;&gt; J.B. can now dance.
&gt;&gt; JoeDoc can now dance.
&gt;&gt; Clio can now dance.</pre>
