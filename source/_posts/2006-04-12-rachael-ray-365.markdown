My wife got this book for Christmas and I gotta say, "it rocks."

We've tried about four of the recipes from this book and each one has been a
hit, combining a really smart combination of tastes together with easy
preparation.

I'll post specifics on the recipes we've tried in the neat future. In the mean
time, here's a link to more information on this really sweet cookbook:
