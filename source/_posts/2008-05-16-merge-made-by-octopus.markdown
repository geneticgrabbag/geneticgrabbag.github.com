I've been coming up to speed on [Git](http://git.or.cz/) and swallowing up
every tutorial and blog entry I can find.

A few days ago, I ran into Jonathan Rockway's very entertaining blog entry
[Git Merging by Example](http://blog.jrock.us/articles/Git%20merging%20by%20example.pod).
Great read and very instructive.  But I was particularly amused by
Jonathan's quote:

{% blockquote %}
I *love* the "Merge made by octopus" message; I am seriously going to have a
t-shirt made that says that.  I like it when sea creatures help maintain my
code.
{% endblockquote %}

You know what?  **I** love when sea creatures help out as well.  So, to that
end I've constructed a little bumper sticker in honor of Git and Jonathan.

Here's a preview:

If you're interested in getting a hold of one of the bumper stickers, leave a
comment.  Sorry it's not a t-shirt, Jonathan, but maybe someday...
