Well, it's the middle of December and my fingernails continue to improve.

<!--more-->
I'm happy to report that the
[orphans are doing well](/blog/2006/08/26/my-fingers-as-of-the-end-of-august/)
and my middle finger (the one that gets the most use) is nearly back to normal.

The nail is sticking to the bed and, except for more white at the nail's edge
than usual, it's back to business.

The ring finger's not as well but quite useable.  When the wound first healed
a small lump of new ping skin grew where the nail was previously.  As the nail
grew, it tried to do a wheelie up and over this hump, driving the nail skyward.
Slowly, this hump appears to be driven out by the new nail and my hope is that
in a year's time the entire nail will lie flat.

Considering the shape of the ring finger
[previously](/blog/2006/08/26/my-fingers-as-of-the-end-of-august/), it's in
remarkably good shape.

Look for an update in March.
