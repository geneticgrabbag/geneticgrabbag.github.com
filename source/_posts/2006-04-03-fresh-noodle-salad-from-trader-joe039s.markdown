For lunch today I had Yama's **Fresh Noodle Salad with Ginger Cilantro-Lime
Dressing**.  My lovely wife picked it up for me from
[Trader Joe's](http://www.traderjoes.com "Trader Joe's").

All i can say is "wow."

It was one of the best pre-packaged meals I've had.  It comes in a round
container about seven inches in diameter.  Inside are the noodles and two
small plastic containers, one with the ginger cilantro-lime dressing; the
other, with cashew bits.  The contents are 12 ounces.

What stood out for me was how _fresh_ the whole thing tasted.

_**Highly recommended.**_
