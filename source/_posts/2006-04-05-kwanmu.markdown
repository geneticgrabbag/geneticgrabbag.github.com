My son and I have been taking karate lessons weekly for about three and half
years now.  And every week there are new techniques to be learned and
previously-taught techniques to be relearned or improved.

My thought is to use this blog to capture some of these ideas so that I can
efer back to them later.  Posts will be filed under the
[Kwanmukan ](http://epmills.com/category/personal/kwanmukan/ "Kwanmukan Category")
category.

Kwanmu, by the way, is Japanese for "realization of the essential."
