Themes:

  * Speed vs. Power
  * Circular Into Linear Motion
  * Oblique Fighting Defense and Counter

<!--more-->

First, we practiced low, inside middle, outside middle and upper defends, once
with ten reps per side with speed and technique but not emphasizing power,
then with five reps per side with technique and power.  The speed reps are
aerobic.

Secondly, we worked on moving from a circular motion to a linear motion.  We
executed a crescent kick (circular motion) but instead of continuing the
rotation to perform a spin kick we instead paused, lifetd the leg towards the
chest and executed a side kick (linear motion). Moving from one motion to the
other requires good balance and strength to halt the spin.

Thirdly, we worked on defending against a lunge punch using a move to the
oblique.  Starting in a closed stance, the attacker starts the step and lunge
punch.  The defender rotates the front foot back and behind (ala the plus
pattern) while executing an outside-inside middle defend against the punch.
This defend is more of a parry than a full block as the intent is simply to
avoid the punch to the face.   Finally, the defender steps in, lowers (ala
ipon kumite #1), twists and delivers a punch to the attacker's side.  The
defender should ensure the non-punching hand is raised to protect the side of
the head.  To counter the defense, the attacker can rotate the punching hand
downward to defend the counterpunch, step the oblique and punch to the head or
side.
