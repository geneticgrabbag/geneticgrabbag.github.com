Trying once again to reset my blog, this time with
[Octopress](http://http://octopress.org/).

After some initial search for ways to convert my old
[WordPress](http://www.wordpress.org) blog data, I ended up writing my own
conversion script using [MySQL](http://www.mysql.org) and
[Node.JS](http://nodejs.org).  In hindsight, I probably should have used
[thomasf's](https://github.com/thomasf)
[exitwp](https://github.com/thomasf/exitwp) script but I didn't discover it in
time.

But because I'd dedicated some time to my script,
[wp2octopress](https://github.com/geneticgrabbag/wp2octopress), I decided to
put it up on [github](http://www.github.com) so I would at least have a record
of my efforts and, if it helps someone else, all the merrier.

In any case, this blog now contains the bulk of my posts from the past.  I
didn't post the old comments from WordPress but there's some good information
and questions from some nice folks, so I may look at porting them over in the
future.

Thanks!
