Earned my brown belt!

<!--more-->
Led the Kwanbu Kihon and Heian Shodan katas, demonstrated Heian Godon, ipon
kumite, hit-move-hit, line drills.

Showed improved flexibility, strong spirit and proper breathing throughout
Heian 5.  Need to improve timing of the end of actions (e.g. the foot landing
at the same moment and the double knife hand completes).

Big thanks to Sensei Hudson!
