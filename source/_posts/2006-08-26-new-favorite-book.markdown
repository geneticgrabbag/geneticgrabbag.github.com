_"Read any good books lately?"_

Well, I've got a new favorite.  It contains all the elements of a great book:
a snappy introduction, intrigue, plot twists and a cliff-hanger of an ending.

As I'm sure you've guessed, I'm referring to
[The Square Root of 3 by Jerry Bonnel and Robert Nemiroff](http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/628),
available on [Project Gutenberg](http://www.gutenberg.org).

> SPOILER ALERT: The 30,788th significant digit is **4**.

In all ernestness, I think [Project Gutenberg](http://www.gutenberg.org) is a
great concept.  But when I ran across this, I just cracked up.
