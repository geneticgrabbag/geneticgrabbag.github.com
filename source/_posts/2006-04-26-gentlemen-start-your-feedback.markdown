I've turned on comments after I found comment spam protection in the form of a
[CAPTCHA](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captcha "CAPTCHA on Wikipedia") code.
Comments are still moderated; however, by typing in the letters and numbers
hown in an image on the comments page you can provide feedback on my posts.

So if you've got any questions or gripes about the ramblings you read on this
site, please, let me know!
