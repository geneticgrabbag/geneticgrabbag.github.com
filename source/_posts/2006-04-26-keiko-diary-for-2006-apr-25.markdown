Today's workout was just that -- a **workout**.  The emphasis was on keeping
our bodies in motion without many breaks.

During the mixed session, most of the time was spent with the kids doing
arious kicks against a pad.  They performed front, side, scissor, crescent and
reverse crescent kicks.  We ended up with flying drift kicks performed while
running full speed and jumping over a stick.

Another emphasis was staying in a horse stance for quite a while.  Knees say,
"ouch."

For the adult session, we did conditioning (20/20/20 crunches front/right/left)
and 45 pushups (5+10+15+10+5).  And we ended with Haien Sandan performed as
practice, all power, all speed and correct dynamics.
