There is no keiko diary for April 11th.

<!--more-->
Instead of the three _other_ things I was supposed to do last night we went
with B, R, H & N to see
[Cathy Rigby](http://www.mccoyrigby.com/cbiofrm.html "Cathy Rigby") in her
farewell performance of [Peter Pan](http://www.peter-pan.com/ "Peter Pan") at
the [Aronoff](http://www.cincinnatiarts.org/venues/aronoff/ "The Aronoff Center for the Arts").
