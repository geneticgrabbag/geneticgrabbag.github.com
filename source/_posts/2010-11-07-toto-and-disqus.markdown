Since I’ve moved from a dynamic blog using
[WordPress](http://www.wordpress.org) to a static one using
[toto](https://github.com/cloudhead/toto/), I’ve had to outsource my
commenting system and have decided to try [Disqus](http://www.disqus.com).

I use [Webbynode](http://www.webbynode.com) for my hosting (love them) and
they have a great
[guide](http://guides.webbynode.com/articles/rapidapps/toto.html)
to setting up and deploying [toto](https://github.com/cloudhead/toto/).

The first step I took was creating an account with
[Disqus](http://www.disqus.com) and
[registering](http://disqus.com/admin/register/)
[epmills.com](http://epmills.com) with them. After you
[register](http://disqus.com/admin/register/) your site,
[Disqus](http://www.disqus.com) provides you with two Javascript scripts to
add to your site. You also need to add a <code>div</code> as a placeholder
where [Disqus](http://www.disqus.com) will insert any comments for the page
along with a text area to enter a new comment.

I cloned [Dorothy](https://github.com/cloudhead/dorothy) to initially
set up my blank website.
