This is the first of my keiko (karate practice) diary entries.

<!--more-->
Sensei took advantage of the fact that no little kids were there to
concentrate on training and conditioning.  _Everyone_ did stairstepped
pushups, kicking line drills and practicing moving into an oblique position by
taking a fighting stance, moving the back foot up (without raising the head)
and moving the other foot back so that the body is on a 45&deg; angle.

We worked on basic fighting technique, specifically using the swap-jump to
better position ourselves for a counterattack.

0.  Attacker and defender in closed fighting stances.
0.  Attacker reverse punches to chest.
0.  Defender perries punch downward while sliding back (ala ipon kumite #3).
0.  Attacker uses swap-jump to position obliquely while raising an easy middle
    defend.  Attacker then steps in, lowers and attacks ribs.

We also studied a few terms:

<dl>
    <dt>Atemi</dt>
    <dd>Vital strike.  "Soft target" one can hit to down an attacker</dd>
    <dt>Kime</dt>
    <dd>Focus</dd>
    <dt>Mai-ai</dt>
    <dd>Interval.  Maintaining the proper distance with an opponent</dd>
    <dt>Zanshin</dt>
    <dd>
        Remaining mind;  After finishing an action, keeping concentration for
        what might happen next
    </dd>
