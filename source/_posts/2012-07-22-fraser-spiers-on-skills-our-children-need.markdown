I've been looking for some new podcasts for my commute to and from work.
I ran across the [Mac Power Users](http://5by5.tv/mpu) podcast.
[David Sparks](http://5by5.tv/people/david-sparks) and
[Katie Floyd](http://5by5.tv/people/katie-floyd) present some pretty cool
stuff on Macs and OS/X.

[Episode #93: Education Workflows with Fraser Speirs](http://5by5.tv/mpu/93)
really drew me in. [Mr. Spiers](http://speirs.org/) is a very engaging
speaker and his views on education impressive.  He's implemented a
one-student-one-iPad program at
[Cedars School of Excellence](cedars.inverclyde.sch.uk/)
in his native Scotland.

One thing he said really grabbed me (paraphrasing):
{% blockquote %}
    Word processing is becoming a skill for secretaries while creating
    presentations that persuade an audience is becoming a skill for CEOs.
{% endblockquote %}

So, I used this as a teaching moment for my son who often asks
{% blockquote %}
    When will I ever use THAT in the real world?
{% endblockquote %}

Well, next time you're working on a PowerPoint presentation for school, ask
yourself, "wouldn't you rather be paid a CEO's salary?"
